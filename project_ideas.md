### Story and Narrative
<!-- Develop the game narrative, including introduction, build-up and resolution -->
#### Introduction
The story begins with a baby mandrill, <u>Pacomonkey</u>, living in a tropical paradise with his mom, <u>(name to be
determined)</u>, a loving white baboon female who breastfeeds him. In the beginning, Pacomonkey can only crawl. 

A few years pass by and now he is a restless happy child who can run, climb and jump (and double jump), but the dark day
arrives. A big black mandrill, <u>(name to be determined)</u> arrives to the village to cause chaos and destruction: 
burns the trees and houses and kills many villagers, leaving orphans most of the kids. Among those kids there is
Pacomonkey and his best friend <u>Pongo</u>, a smart but coward orangutan.

As the months pass by, Pacomonkey's rage dominates him and decides to leave the village to seek vengeance against the
monster who destroyed everything he loved.

#### Build-up
Pacomonkey's village, <u>(name to be determined)</u>, is ruled by a greedy and smug monkey named <u>Langur de
François</u>, and his only desire is power, and fashion. When Pacomonkey goes to see him to ask for his permission to
leave the village, Langur refuses. But as Pacomonkey insists he decides to offer him a way out: "Only if a diamond is 
brought up to me, I will grant my permission to leave. The diamond is somewhere hidden in this village, if you find it
and bring it to me, you will have my permission to leave.". But the true intentions of the leader are way darker: he 
knows that no diamonds exist in this village, he only wants to trap the remaining population here and dominate all of 
them.

- If Pacomonkey talks to <u>(name to be determined)</u>, Langur's subordinate, she will tell him the real plans of the
leader and Pacomonkey will return to Langur to face him, and fight him for his friend's and his freedom.


- If Pacomonkey doesn't talk to her, he will keep searching for the diamond until he visits Langur again. When Langur
sees him again he will laugh at him and say "Hahaha. Keep looking for the diamond, Pacomonkey. Hahahaha!". Then 
Pacomonkey will be offered to choose between fighting him or keep searching for the diamond. If he chooses to keep
searching for the diamond, </u>(name to be determined)</u> will scream "He is lying to you! He doesn't want anyone to
leave! There are no diamonds in this place!". After her confession, Langur will beat her badly and Pacomonkey will fight
him.

(...)

#### Resolution
After a long journey, Pacomonkey finally finds <u>(name to be determined)</u>, his mom's killer, inside the volcano 
mountain. But a lot of time has past since he left his little village, and now the black baboon who destroyed everything
is nothing more than an tired old monkey. Pacomonkey will have to decide between forgiveness and compassion or complete
his revenge.

When Pacomonkey starts fighting him, after the first hit he throws, a young mandrill named <u>(name to be determined)</u>,
(name to be determined)'s grandson, will throw his granddad a (to be determined: magic cane, potion, idk) and he will
become a young baboon again for the last time. 

<u>(name to be determined)</u> will be overpowered, with every ability that Pacomonkey has acquired through the entire
game. When Pacomonkey finally defeats him, he will have to decide whether to kill him or spare his live.

- If Pacomonkey decides to kill him, he will see through the eyes of the little (name to be determined) how he has
become what he swore to destroy, the very monster itself, and the perpetuator of this endless cycle of violence. 


- If Pacomonkey decides to spare his live, (...)
